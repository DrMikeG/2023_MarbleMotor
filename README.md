You must also supply 5-12VDC to power the motor. There are two ways to do this

You can power the Arduino via the DC Barrel Jack and insert the VIN Jumper shown as the tall black handle right next to the green Power LED below
You can power the Arduino via the DC Barrel jack or USB port. Then Power the shield via the 5-12VDC motor power terminal port, the double terminal block next to the green Power LED and remove the VIN jumper
If the Green LED isn't lit up brightly do not continue - you must power it via the VIN jumper or the terminal block
